# AGENTS.md

> **Note:** If you use multiple coding assistants, make `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` symlinks to this file.

## Project Structure

Current repository state:
- `docs/references.md`: baseline research for Bitbucket CLI scope, API references, and MVP direction.
- `docs/SPEC.md`: canonical technical specification for the active implementation target, including agent-oriented CLI rules.
- `.context/TASKS.md`: work item tracker for agent-level execution status.
- `.context/STEERING.md`: high-level plan tracker (phases, success criteria, current focus).

Project goal (source of truth: `docs/references.md`):
- Build a Bitbucket CLI similar to `gh` and `tea`.
- Keep first implementation focused on **Bitbucket Cloud**.

If you add source code, keep layout simple and explicit:
- Put runtime code in one top-level code directory (for example `src/` or language-standard equivalent).
- Put tests in one clear test location (for example `tests/` or language-standard equivalent).
- Update this file once the toolchain is chosen.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple agents split work, use these files as the single source of execution state:
- `.context/STEERING.md`: tracks objective, phase order, success criteria, and current phase owner.
- `.context/TASKS.md`: tracks actionable tasks as checkboxes (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`) with owner and blocker notes.

Mandatory startup rule for every agent task:
1. Read `.context/STEERING.md` first.
2. Read `.context/TASKS.md` second.
3. Read `docs/SPEC.md` for the current technical spec and agent-facing behavior constraints.
4. Only then start implementation.

If there is any ambiguity about command behavior, output contracts, or agent-facing constraints, resolve it against `docs/SPEC.md` before changing code.

Update rules during work:
- Before starting a task, assign the owner and add `(in progress)` on that task line.
- If plan/sequence changed, update `.context/STEERING.md` before coding continues.
- On completion, change checkbox to `- [x]` and sync any follow-up work items.

## Build & Development

Primary toolchain: **Rust 1.93.0** via `rust-toolchain.toml`

Useful current commands:
- List tracked/untracked files quickly:
  ```bash
  rg --files -uu
  ```
- Read planning state before any implementation:
  ```bash
  sed -n '1,240p' .context/STEERING.md
  sed -n '1,240p' .context/TASKS.md
  sed -n '1,260p' docs/SPEC.md
  ```
- Review project reference:
  ```bash
  sed -n '1,240p' docs/references.md
  ```
- Review command contracts:
  ```bash
  sed -n '1,260p' docs/command-contracts.md
  ```
- Run CLI locally:
  ```bash
  cargo run --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p bb-cli --bin bb -- --help
  ```
- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml
  ```
- Run clippy with warnings denied:
  ```bash
  cargo clippy --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
  ```
- Format Rust files:
  ```bash
  cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all
  ```
- Check formatting without rewriting files:
  ```bash
  cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all --check
  ```
- Install repo-managed Git hooks:
  ```bash
  make hooks-install
  ```

## Code Standards

### Do
- Read `.context/STEERING.md` and `.context/TASKS.md` before any implementation task.
- Read `docs/SPEC.md` for the current implementation contract before coding.
- Keep changes directly tied to the current task; avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Prefer the smallest implementation that satisfies requirements.
- When technical behavior changes, update `docs/SPEC.md` in the same change.
- When technical choices, API scopes, endpoint usage, or architecture assumptions change, update `docs/references.md` if the change affects project direction.
- Keep the first release Cloud-only unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- Mirror proven CLI shape from references (`auth`, `repo`, `pr`, `pipeline`, `issue`, `wiki`, `api`, `completion`).
- When a command maps directly to a Bitbucket Cloud REST operation, prefer the Bitbucket API operation/resource naming over wrapper synonyms (for example `get`/`update` instead of `view`/`edit`).
- Implement API pagination using Bitbucket `next` links.
- Support both human-readable output and JSON output for automation.
- Keep non-interactive behavior deterministic with explicit flags when needed.
- Keep local quality checks aligned across `.githooks/`, `Makefile`, and GitHub Actions.

### Don’t
- Don’t silently assume requirements when multiple interpretations exist; state assumptions.
- Don’t implement Bitbucket Data Center support in Cloud MVP work.
- Don’t use deprecated auth paths as the default design.
- Don’t add abstractions before a clear second use-case exists.
- Don’t change unrelated files or formatting.

### Write Operation Safety
- Use a dedicated test repository for write operations (`bb pr create`, `bb pipeline run`, `bb issue create`, `bb issue update`, `bb wiki put`) during development.
- Keep production repos on read-only tokens unless write access is explicitly needed.

## After Code Changes

Always verify at the smallest meaningful scope first.

Current minimum checklist:
1. Ensure files are where expected:
   ```bash
   rg --files -uu
   ```
2. Re-open planning files and verify status is current:
   ```bash
   sed -n '1,240p' .context/STEERING.md
   sed -n '1,240p' .context/TASKS.md
   ```
3. Re-open changed docs and check for coherence:
   ```bash
   sed -n '1,240p' docs/references.md
   ```
   If the task changed technical assumptions, ensure `docs/references.md` is updated in the same change.
4. If `AGENTS.md` changed, re-read it for internal consistency:
   ```bash
   sed -n '1,260p' AGENTS.md
   ```

Use file-scoped checks first when possible (e.g. `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -p bb-core`).

Before creating a commit in normal development flow:
1. Install repo-managed hooks once per clone:
   ```bash
   make hooks-install
   ```
2. Let `pre-commit` enforce:
   ```bash
   make fmt-check
   make lint
   ```
3. Let `pre-push` enforce:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Definition of Done

A task is done only when all of the following are true:
- The requested code or documentation change is implemented with the smallest necessary diff.
- `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/references.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.context/STEERING.md`, and `.context/TASKS.md` are updated when the task changes their source-of-truth scope.
- Relevant verification commands have been run at the smallest meaningful scope and passed, or any skipped checks are called out explicitly.
- The final diff is reviewable and free of unrelated edits.
- The final change set is ready to land through the Git/PR flow below.
- The DoD checklist is the gate before final commit/PR work begins; do not treat a task as complete while it only exists as an uncommitted local diff.

After the DoD checklist is satisfied, do not treat the task as closed until all of the following are complete:
1. Put the final change set on a branch based on the latest `main`.
2. Split the work into logical commits that match reviewable steps in the implementation.
3. Push that branch to `origin`.
4. Open a PR with the summary, verification commands, assumptions, and unresolved questions.

## Testing

Testing uses Rust's standard testing support via Cargo.

Rules:
- Prefer fast, file-scoped tests first.
- For bug fixes, reproduce with a failing test before implementing the fix.
- Do not claim a fix is complete until the reproduction test passes.
- Prefer focused crate/package tests before running the full workspace.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- Keep each change set focused on one goal.
- Use a branch based on the latest `main` for the final reviewable change set.
- Once the DoD checklist is satisfied, create the final commit sequence immediately; do not leave completed work uncommitted.
- Split non-trivial work into logical commits instead of one large checkpoint commit.
- A logical commit should represent one reviewable step, for example docs, parser/runtime behavior, or tests.
- If the work naturally breaks into multiple implementation stages, commit those stages in order after verification so the branch history explains how the change was built.
- Do not mix unrelated cleanup into the same commit.
- Push the review branch and open a PR once the DoD checklist is satisfied.
- Include verification commands actually run.
- If a command could not be run, state that explicitly.
- Document assumptions and unresolved questions in the PR description.
- When work is completed normally, create one or more commits for the finished scope before handing off.
- Before committing, ensure `.context/STEERING.md` and `.context/TASKS.md` reflect final status.
- Suggested commit flow:
  1. Group the finished diff into logical review units.
  2. `git add` only the files for the first logical unit.
  3. `git commit` with a focused message.
  4. Repeat until the completed work is fully represented by logical commits.
  5. Push the branch and open the PR.
  ```bash
  git add AGENTS.md .context/STEERING.md .context/TASKS.md
  git commit -m "docs: define multi-agent plan/task workflow"
  ```

## Secrets & Environment

- Never commit access tokens, OAuth secrets, or credentials.
- Never hardcode Bitbucket credentials in source code or docs.
- Use local environment configuration that is excluded from version control.

## Known Gotchas

- Bitbucket Cloud and Data Center APIs differ significantly; do not mix them accidentally.
- For list endpoints, rely on API-provided pagination (`next`) instead of hand-built page URLs.
- Keep auth design aligned with current Bitbucket Cloud recommendations; avoid deprecated defaults.
